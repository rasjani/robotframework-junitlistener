robotframework-junitlistener
============================

Listener that can generate valid junit file that is supported by Jenkins.

Uses a interal and modified copy of junit_xml project which is licensed under MIT.
This is due to the fact that latest release of the junit_xml package is buggy but
fixed in github repo but then again, setup tools does not like installing packages
directly from git url's..
